Power and type are determined by the user's [IV]{mechanic:iv}s.\n\nPower is given by `x * 40 / 63 + 30`.  `x` is obtained by arranging bit 1 from the [IV]{mechanic:iv} for each of [Special Defense]{mechanic:special-defense}, [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack}, [Speed]{mechanic:speed}, [Defense]{mechanic:defense}, [Attack]{mechanic:attack}, and [HP]{mechanic:hp} in that order.  (Bit 1 is 1 if the [IV]{mechanic:iv} is of the form `4n + 2` or `4n + 3`.  `x` is then 64 * [Special Defense]{mechanic:special-defense} [IV]{mechanic:iv} bit 1, plus 32 * [Special Attack]{mechanic:special-attack} [IV]{mechanic:iv} bit 1, etc.)\n\nPower is always between 30 and 70, inclusive.  Average power is 49.5.\n\nType is given by `y * 15 / 63`, where `y` is similar to `x` above, except constructed from bit 0.  (Bit 0 is 1 if the [IV]{mechanic:iv} is odd.)  The result is looked up in the following table.\n\nValue | Type\n----: | --------\n    0 | []{type:fighting}\n    1 | []{type:flying}\n    2 | []{type:poison}\n    3 | []{type:ground}\n    4 | []{type:rock}\n    5 | []{type:bug}\n    6 | []{type:ghost}\n    7 | []{type:steel}\n    8 | []{type:fire}\n    9 | []{type:water}\n   10 | []{type:grass}\n   11 | []{type:electric}\n   12 | []{type:psychic}\n   13 | []{type:ice}\n   14 | []{type:dragon}\n   15 | []{type:dark}\n\nThis move thus cannot be []{type:normal}.  Most other types have an equal 1/16 chance to be selected, given random [IV]{mechanic:iv}s.
