If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. []{ability:dry-skin} or []{ability:unaware}, the ability is ignored either way.\n\nAbilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, []{ability:cursed-body} only affects potential future uses of the move, while []{ability:liquid-ooze} and []{ability:shadow-tag} can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example []{ability:color-change} or []{ability:forecast}; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from []{ability:drizzle}.  This ability cannot ignore []{ability:multitype} at all.\n\nAn ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can [paralyze]{mechanic:paralysis} a Pokémon with []{ability:limber}, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's []{move:spikes} are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.\n\nWhen this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.\n\nThis ability functions identically to []{ability:mold-breaker} and []{ability:turboblaze}.",
